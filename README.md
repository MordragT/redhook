redhook
=======

redhook is a helper crate for writing interposition libraries
(`LD_PRELOAD`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, etc.) in Rust.

To use redhook, add the lines

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate redhook;
```

to your library, then use the `hook!` macro to declare the function you
want to hook, and the name you want to give to your hook function:

```rust
hook! {
    unsafe fn existing_function(x: i32) -> i32 => my_function {
        42
    }
}
```

To access the underlying function, use `real!(existing_function)`.

Compile your library as a `dylib`, which can be done via
`rustc --crate-type=dylib`, or by adding

```
[lib]
name = "mylib"
crate_type = ["dylib"]
```

to your `Cargo.toml`. Then find the resulting `.so` file (`./mylib.so`
for rustc, or inside `target` for Cargo) and set the `LD_PRELOAD`
environment variable to that.

There are a few [examples](examples) included, as separate crates:

```

```

redhook currently supports building interposition libraries for
`LD_PRELOAD` on glibc (GNU/Linux) and `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on Apple's
libc (Mac OS X) from the same source code. If you're interested in
support for other platforms, please file an issue or pull request.

redhook is named after the [Red Hook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hook,_Brooklyn)
neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Portions of the implementation
borrow heavily from concepts in @Kimundi's
[`lazy_static!`](https://github.com/Kimundi/lazy-static.rs) macro.

redhook is free software, available under the terms of the
[2-clause BSD license](COPYING).

**Please note that no attempt is made to catch panics.** Once
the code changes for [RFC 1236](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md)
land and are stable, I'll release a version that depends on them.
Until then, **your code must ensure that it never panics**.
